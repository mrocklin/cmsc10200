        <h1> HTML Tips </h1>
        
        <h2> Headers </h2>
        <h2> Formatting </h2>
        <h2> Hyperlinks </h2> 
        <h2> Images </h2>
        <p> Images are handled very similarly to links. To the right we've included two images of Tim Berners-Lee, the originator of the term HTML. The rightmost image is served from the wikipedia servers, the left image is served from this computer. 
        
        <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg" alt="An image of Tim Berners-Lee" width=20% align="right"/>
        
        <img src="images/tim.jpg" alt="An image of Tim Berners-Lee" width=20% align="right">
        
        <p> We specify the source location of the image using the "src" attribute. The src can be any URL, usually either a link to an image on the web or a file on our own computer. I've downloaded this image and saved it locally in <code>images/tim.jpg</code>. 

        <p> There are a few other attributes present. "alt" is the alternative text for displays that don't handle images. "width" and "align" give control about image size and placement. A list of other handy image attributes are available <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_IMG.asp">here</a>
